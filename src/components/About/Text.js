            <p id="parapgrah1" class="text-container">I decided to work in the tech industry after a few years of soul-searching, looking for a line of work
            that would truly fit my skills and personality. I have always loved taking on challenges and working
            hard towards goals; for instance, in 2017 I qualified as an English teacher in the British school
            system, despite not being a native speaker. My lifelong passion for the English language and literature
            drew me to the education sector, and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to pass it on to teenagers.
            However, I slowly came to realise that I didn't love being in the classroom as much as I thought I
            would, and that having to perform for a live audience all day was wearing me thin. Besides,
            I realised I craved more opportunities for reflective, analytical and theoretical work in my every day
            life, which was an aspect of academic research that I had relished and excelled at. </p>
            <p id="paragraph2" class="text-container">Those reservations led me to start thinking about other careers that I could find fulfilling, and
            software engineering appeared to be a field that would satisfy my desire for intellectually-challenging
            and meaningful work. I am now currently completing the Northcoders bootcamp course online, and I am
            finding deep satisfaction and happiness as the weeks progress and my skillset grows as I take on
            increasingly complex challenges. I am currently completing the front-end modules, learning about HTML, CSS
            and React as well as to how connect the front and back ends of a webiste. I am learning about the tech
            industry as well, and value very much its
            openness to newcomers
            from various backgrounds, and its meritocratic approach to recruitment. I hope to continue growing my
            technical skills long after I graduate from the bootcamp, and will be happy to use them in combinations
            with other skills learned during previous employment and academic work.
